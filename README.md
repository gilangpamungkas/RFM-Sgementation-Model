This repository contains the analysis and visualizations of RFM Segmentation Model I have created in R .

### RFM Segmentation
#### About
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer's behaviour because frequency and monetary value affects a customer's lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.

Businesses that lack the monetary aspect, like viewership, readership, or surfing-oriented products, could use engagement parameters instead of monetary factors. This results in using RFE - a variation of RFM. Furthermore, this engagement parameter could be defined as a composite value based on metrics such as bounce rate, visit duration, number of pages visited, time spent per page, etc.


#### Dataset
The data set from a sample of customer transactions of an e-commerce logistics startup in a certain period.
